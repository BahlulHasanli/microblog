The next State of Play is coming this Wednesday, and it will be entirely focused on giving us a 30-minute deep dive into _007 First Light._ You can watch it live on the PlayStation’s official <mark style="background-color:var(--tt-color-highlight-purple)">[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/playstation)</mark> and <mark style="background-color:var(--tt-color-highlight-purple)">[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation)</mark> channels on\*\* \*\*September 3 at 2 p.m. EDT/11 a.m. PDT.

<mark style="background-color:var(--tt-color-highlight-purple)">[According to the PlayStation blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/)</mark>, this State of Play presentation will feature gameplay of the first mission young James Bond — still an MI6 recruit — takes part in. This segment is going to show examples of the kind of action we can expect from _First Light_, “from high-speed card chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts.”

_007 First Light_ was announced back in June, during a <mark style="background-color:var(--tt-color-highlight-purple)">[State of Play where a long list of titles for the Sony platform were showcased](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/603446/playstation-state-of-play-news-trailers-june-2025/)</mark><mark style="background-color:var(--tt-color-highlight-purple)">. </mark>This new James Bond game is being developed by IO Interactive, the studio behind the Hitman series of stealth games. This time, instead of the experienced and charming Bond, we’re playing as the young James, who’s still learning the ropes as an MI6 agent.
