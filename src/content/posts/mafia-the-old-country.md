rowing up, my father and I never saw eye to eye. We were always engaged in an ideological war, as my passion for creativity clashed with his cold focus on making money and putting food on the table above all else. There was a cultural divide between us that took me nearly two decades to understand. While I was born and raised in Massachusetts, he grew up on the outskirts of Capestrano, a small town nestled into the Italian countryside.

I wouldn’t understand how different those worlds were until I watched Bicycle Thieves, Vittorio De Sica’s 1948 neorealist classic about a poor father trying to provide for his family in post-World War 2 Rome. It was through that film that I felt like I really saw my father for the first time. The film is an honest portrait of Italian anxiety of the time, depicting how poverty pushed decent men to desperation. Even if he was in America now and doing well for himself, there was still a part of his brain that would always be struggling to scrape by in the hills of Abruzzo.
