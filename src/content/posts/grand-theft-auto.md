Grand Theft Auto 6's publisher dodged on providing hard numbers when asked about the pricing of Rockstar Games' highly anticipated open-world crime epic, but said that Take-Two Interactive's goal with game costs is "to deliver more value than what we charge," according to a new interview with Variety.

Pricing for GTA 6 "will come from Rockstar in due time," Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said Thursday, ahead of covering the company's earnings. Take-Two boasted that in a better-than-expected response, Grand Theft Auto 5 has reached a new sales milestone, topping more than 215 million units. Overall, the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold "nearly 455 million units" to date.

Zelnick is obviously cognizant of recent controversy around game prices and loose talk about whether GTA 6 might cost $80 or even $100, given its massive scope and lengthy development cycle. Zelnick didn't commit to any kind of pricing — GTA 6 is still nine months away — but instead acknowledged game industry pricing tactics of launching with a "premium price, sometimes with special editions," and dropping prices over time. That may very well be the plan for GTA 6.

Whatever Grand Theft Auto 6 will ultimately cost, Rockstar Games hasn't said. What Rockstar has revealed are two trailers for GTA 6, the first of which racked up 93 million views in 24 hours, and the second of which blew that out of the water with 475 million views in 24 hours.
