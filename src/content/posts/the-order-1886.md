Set in an alternate 19th century timeline where, thousands of years ago, a genetically distinct strain of humanity evolved from the rest of mankind to become 'Half-Breeds' - humans with bestial traits - the emergence of which swiftly led to an inter-species conflict which has been fought for centuries.  

As the first and most pressing priority across the globe, the constant war for humanity's very existence against the Half-Breeds thus brought about advances in culture, technology, and weaponry far quicker than in our own timeline, in which no such singular purpose would have led to such progress in those fields.
